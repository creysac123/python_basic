    "- The \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance allows class members (fields and methods) to be accessible by derived classes within the same class hierarchy.\n",
    "- It promotes code reusability by enabling derived classes to access and customize inherited members.\n",
    "- While \"protected\" provides this level of access, it restricts direct access from code outside the class hierarchy, maintaining encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences from \"private\" and \"public\" Modifiers:**\n",
    "- **Private:** Members with \"private\" access are only accessible within the defining class. They are not visible to derived classes or external code. This offers strong encapsulation and hides implementation details.\n",
    "- **Public:** Members with \"public\" access are accessible from any part of the program, including derived classes and external code. There are no access restrictions, allowing for full visibility and interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the \"protected\" access modifier strikes a balance between \"private\" and \"public.\" It enables customization by derived classes while restricting access from external code, making it useful for controlled inheritance and promoting code reusability."

    "- The \"super\" keyword is used to access and invoke methods or constructors from the parent class (superclass) in inheritance.\n",
    "- It allows a derived class to reuse and extend the functionality of its parent class.\n",
    "- \"super\" is particularly useful when the parent and child classes have methods or constructors with the same name, helping to disambiguate and specify which one to call.\n",
    "**Example in Python:**\n",
    "Suppose we have a Python class hierarchy with a parent class `Vehicle` and a child class `Car`. The child class wants to invoke the constructor of the parent class using the \"super\" keyword.\n",
